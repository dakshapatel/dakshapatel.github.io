Let me highlight the reasons why...

1.You've got a problem? I have a solution! 

My favorite tv show during my teens years was Macgyver. Who doesn't love a guy that has an extraordinary knack for unconventional problem solving and an extensive bank of scientific knowledge that can best be put to saving lives. Exactly! 

2. Instant gratification.

There is nothing better than partaking in the fruits of ones labor. 

3. Creativity.. say what?

Artsy is not an adjective I would use to describe myself. Problem solving takes creativity. Tapping into that creative side makes me a happy. 

4. Work and have a life? 

Its an appealing prospect to have a life outside of work, and I WANT THAT!! 

5. Solitary life (umm.. no thanks!)

Working with others and collaborating is fun and brings new ideas to the table. 

6. Consider this.. 

    i.   There is a demand for software developers. Expected to grow 17% over the next 10 years. 
		ii.  Make a decent living that can support your family. And take a vacation once in a while. 
		iii. A lot of diversity on the type of projects and work that you can do. 
		iv. Live in the desert or in a major metropolis and still work. No need to uproot your life. 
		v.  Working remotely is not frowned upon. 
		vi. I can keep going on and on but I have to get back to coding....
